# Contributing to the playbook

## What

The playbook is still fairly new, so there are many opportunities to add useful
content. Here are some examples:

* Build out the Ruby section
* Add a Rails section
* Expand on the Python section
* Curated list of books, articles, newsletters, courses, tutorials
* Recommended tools
* Create separate pages for the various editors and IDEs, and expand each with
more helpful plugins, keyboard shortcuts, and other productivity tips.
* How to be an effective engineer

## When

We aim for the playbook to be a living document. Outdated information can be
worse than no information. If we change our opinions or processes, we should
strive to update the playbook shortly thereafter.

If you feel important content is missing, please submit a PR if you have the
time. Otherwise, please add a new backlog story to the
[Company Wide Projects](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2120515)
Pivotal board, which is managed by folks on Reserve.

## How

Contributing is as easy as submitting a PR. Please request a review from one or
more of these Trussels we have identified as curators for particular areas of
knowledge:

* General Backend - TBD
* General Frontend - TBD
* Go - TBD
* Infra - TBD
* Python - TBD
* Rails - TBD

If you are adding new content, please follow our
[templates](./templates/README.md). If you are updating existing content, and
you notice that it does not adhere to our templates format, please update the
format in a separate PR if you have time. Otherwise, please create a new backlog
story in the [Company Wide Projects](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/2120515)
Pivotal board, which is managed by folks on Reserve.
