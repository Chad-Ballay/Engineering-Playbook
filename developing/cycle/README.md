# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Development Cycle

## Overview

The kind of iterative development we do consists of a number of repeated cycles (Sprints) during which a number of development stories are planned and executed. At the end of each cycle the work is reviewed against the intentions for the week and alongside the then current priorities.

TBD Talk about cycle length, priorities for cycle & tooling
