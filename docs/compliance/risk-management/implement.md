# Risk Management Framework - Step 3: Implement

Controls specified in the System Security Plan (SSP) are implemented by taking into account NIST SP 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations and the minimum organization requirements (i.e., organizationally defined parameters).

A team must implement the selected security controls and document all the processes and procedures they need to maintain their operation. This includes implementing the security controls and documenting the security control implementation details, as appropriate, in the security plan.

There are three types of control implementation:

**System Specific Controls** - System-specific controls are security controls that provide a security capability for a particular information system only and are the primary responsibility of information system owners and their AO.

**Common Controls** - Common controls are security controls that can support multiple information systems efficiently and effectively as a common capability. When these controls are used to support a specific information system, they are referenced by that specific system as inherited controls.

**Hybrid Controls** - Hybrid controls are security controls where one part of the control is deemed to be common and another part of the control is deemed to be system-specific.
