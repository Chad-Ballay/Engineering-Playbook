# [Engineering Playbook](../README.md) / Tools and Practice

## Overview

This section addresses the tools and practices which are part of the everyday habits of being a Software Engineer at Truss.

In this, as in all things, Truss aims to find a balance between giving people the autonomy and tools to make the best choices in whatever situation they find themselves and avoiding revisiting questions again and again. The latter is especially true where the question is not material or core to how we do business. In some cases, we have strong opinions about which questions are not valuable as a cause for debate, e.g. [Tabs vs Spaces](https://truss.works/blog/2017/11/3/tabs-vs-spaces-a-tale-of-asking-the-wrong-questions).

Generally, our approach should be "if there is a suggestion or answer in these pages, follow it until you have a *compelling* reason not to". Once you have a compelling reason to change the practice document it by adding to or updating these pages.
