# Risk Management Framework - Step 6: Monitor

Risk management is a continuous process. Information systems are in a constant state of change with upgrades to hardware, software, or firmware and modifications to the surrounding environments where the systems reside and operate. A structured approach to managing, controlling, and documenting changes to an information system or its environment of operation is an essential element of an effective monitoring program. Strict configuration management and control processes are established by the agency to support such monitoring activities.

Security Impact Analysis (SIA) determines the extent to which proposed or actual changes to the information system or its environment of operation can affect or have affected the security state of the system. Changes to the information system or its environment of operation may affect the security controls currently in place, produce new vulnerabilities in the system, or generate requirements for new security controls that were not needed previously. If the results of the SIA indicate that the proposed or actual changes can affect or have affected the security state of the system, corrective actions are initiated and appropriate documents are revised and updated.

## More detailed reading from NIST

- [SP 800-37](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-37-rev1/sp800-37-rev1-final.pdf) provides guidance for applying the risk management framework, start to end.
- [SP 800-53A](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5.pdf) describes customizable procedures to assess how the framework, as applied, works with the agency's risk tolerance. How you assess the framework is a key input to your ongoing monitoring processes.
