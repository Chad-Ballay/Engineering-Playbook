# Risk Management Framework - Step 2: Select

Controls are the management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures employed within an organizational information system that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its information. The specific controls required to protect the system are based on the categorization of the system.

Security and privacy control baselines serve as a starting point for the protection of information, information systems, and individualsâ€™ privacy. NIST SP 800-53B defines these security and privacy control baselines. The three defined control baselines contain sets of security controls and control enhancements that offer protection for information and information systems that have been categorized as low-impact, moderate-impact, or high-impact.

These are the security and privacy control families for information systems in NIST SP 800-53 rev. 5. Specific controls and control enhancements are found within each control family.
