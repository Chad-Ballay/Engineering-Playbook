# 0005 - JavaScript dependency management

**Status:** WIP (_initial draft_)

**Date Accepted:** n/a for now

**Reviewers:** #g-frontend

:::info
This ADR uses Tabs to separate specific code or documentation between the
`npm-cli` and the `classic yarn-cli`.
:::

## Context

Truss leverages both _NPM_ and _Yarn_ for dependency management for JavaScript
projects. While these tools accomplish similar tasks, there are different in
ways they operate. Teams who choose one tool over the other, must have
documentation related to managing dependencies specific for their that team.

Truss can provide best practices for how to manage JavaScript dependencies that
can be used as a starting point for a team's or project's specific tooling
around dependency management. This ADR seeks to do just that.

The specific areas this ADR covers are the following:

- dependency resolution
    - version locking
- updating dependencies
- working with files such as: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and
  `yarn.lock`.

### JavaScript Dependency Management Tool

Truss recommends that projects use _NPM_ instead of _Yarn_ as it is included with
Node and has commercial support. Projects that leverage _Yarn_ or any other
**JavaScript Dependency Management Tool** (JDMT from now on) will need to
document this in ways outside of the scope of this ADR.

This ADR is not meant to endorse one JDMT over the other and ultimately places the
decision on engineering teams using these tools. There are certain ways these
tools work together and this document will aim to cover those scenarios
equitably.

## Decision

When dealing with JavaScript dependencies and JDMT, there are certain files that
are always in-play. These files include a package file and a lock file which
stores the version installed of these packages. This decision covers some of the
ways to do this in either _Yarn_ or _NPM_.

### Dependency resolution

Regardless of the JDMT being used, there will always be a `package.json` file
which will contain the three different sections for dependencies. When it comes
to installing dependencies in these sections, ensure that any commands for the
JDMT leverage the exact version that you are trying to install.

<Tabs groupID="JDMT">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm-cli">

```shell title="installing all dependencies in NPM"
>_ npm install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="classic yarn-cli">

```shell title="installing all dependencies in Yarn"
>_ yarn
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Dependencies

- listed in `"dependencies": {}` in `package.json`
- needed for the site work
- example: the site won't work in production without React

<Tabs groupID="JDMT">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm-cli">

```shell title="installing react version 1.0.1 exactly using NPM as a dependency"
>_ npm install --save-exact react@1.0.1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="classic yarn-cli">

```shell title="installing react version 1.0.1 exactly using Yarn as a dependency"
>_ yarn add react@1.0.1
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Development Dependencies

- listed in `"devDependencies": {}` in `package.json`.
- used in development, but not production
- example: we use Prettier to format code

<Tabs groupID="JDMT">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm-cli">

```shell title="installing prettier version 1.0.1 exactly using NPM as a development dependency"
>_ npm install --save-exact --save-dev prettier@1.0.1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="classic yarn-cli">

```shell title="installing prettier version 1.0.1 exactly using Yarn as a development dependency"
>_ yarn add --dev prettier@1.0.1
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Peer Dependencies

- listed in `"peerDependencies": {}` in `package.json`
- used to express the compatibility of your package with a host tool or library
    - typically only found in packages intended to be published to _NPM_
- works with or alongside another library
- example: `@material-ui/icons` works with `@material-ui/core`

#### Version locking

You will notice that all of the packages listed are set to specific versions
(instead of a range using the `^` or `~` characters). This is to help ensure
that installing dependencies is deterministic and it also means we are in full
control of all version updates.

By default, JDMT will use the `^` caret character for the version which does not
lead to control of what version get installed when running the JDMT installation
command. Avoid using semantic version ranges when install dependencies by using
some of the commands listed above around installation.

### Updating dependencies

<Tabs groupID="JDMT">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm-cli">

There is currently no way to accomplish this at the command-line in an
interactive manner.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn" label="classic yarn-cli">

The `yarn upgrade-interactive` CLI is incredibly useful when updating
dependencies on a regular basis. Since we are version locking all dependencies,
run with the `--latest` flag to update everything to the most recent version:

```shell title="Using Yarn to upgrade dependencies interactively"
>_ yarn upgrade-interactive --latest
```

This will list all direct dependencies that have new versions, color-coded by
the update type (major, minor, patch), as well as a link to the package
homepage. You can navigate up/down the list using the up/down arrow keys, select
which packages to update with the SPACE bar, and hit ENTER to install the new
versions of the selected packages.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

It's a good idea to start with low-risk updates and work your way up from there.
The goal of doing this on a regular basis is _not_ to update all packages to
their most recent versions all the time. Most likely you will not be able to do
this! The goal should be instead to update as many as possible with as little
effort as possible. That means starting with packages that are only used during
development (`devDependencies`), that have minor or patch updates (which should
in theory mean no breaking changes), and that can be easily tested with
automated checks. This might mean starting with low hanging fruit such as
testing tools, linting plugins, type definitions, etc. Gradually work your way
towards dependencies used by the application itself & in production.

Part of deciding whether or not to update a package should probably involve
actually looking for the changelog of what the update includes. Depending on the
library, this can be easy or not to find. Some libraries use GitHub releases to
track versions and changes; others will publish upgrade guides on their
websites; some might stick changes in a `CHANGELOG.md` file, and others might
not publish changes at all. But knowing _what_ is actually changing in the code
when you update a package can help immensely with having the confidence that
nothing will break, as well as knowing what part of the code might be affected
and what to test.

Another tip is to update related packages together. For example, it's often the
case that all `@storybook` packages will need to be updated at the same time to
maintain compatibility. `react` and `react-dom` have the same requirement. This
is where having a reasonable understanding of _what_ the packages are and
how/why they're used comes into play.

An example update path might look like:

- Update all eslint related packages/plugins
  - Run the linter to make sure there are no new issues
- Update all Jest/testing-library related packages
  - Run the tests to make sure there are no new test failures
- Update packages related to the compilation/build config (such as Babel,
  TypeScript, etc.)
  - Run the build to make sure it still compiles without errors
- Update all Storybook packages
  - Run Storybook to make sure the build still works
- Update production dependencies grouped by feature/function/runtime
  - i.e., `next, @opentelemetry, apollo-server`, etc.
  - Run the application in both development & production modes, test manually
  - Run automated tests

#### What about code changes?

What happens when a package update requires code changes? In theory, if
following strict semantic versioning, patch & minor updates never should.
However, not all packages follow semantic versioning, and also all packages are
(probably) maintained by humans, who make mistakes. Required changes might fall
under any of the following categories:

- Small, semantic or not functionally different, documented code/API changes
- More substantial, documented changes that might have a functional impact
- Undocumented changes needed because of unexpected issues or edge cases

When & how you make these changes can be a gut feeling based on the situation.
If an update requires making a small change in a handful of places, that could
be easily completed as part of the regular update cadence. If an update requires
an easy change but one that will cause a diff in many files (such as a renamed
import), it might make sense to isolate that on a separate branch. If an update
requires upgrading several packages at once, and/or also making substantial code
changes, that should probably also be done on its own.

Ultimately, the goal is to minimize risk by ensuring that whatever changes you
do make can be easily tested, and if an issue is found it's straightforward to
either debug or roll back from. That all comes down to identifying what
package introduced the issue, and how to resolve it. If a change involves
updating many packages _and_ making many code changes at once, that will be
much more difficult.

### Working with files used and generated by JDMT

When working with either _Yarn_ or _NPM_, there are Lock files that are
generated by the JDMT. These files should be checked into version control. The
Lock files should never be edited directly. If merge conflicts occur, run the
JDMT command to regenerate the Lock file to resolve conflicts.

Lock files prevent updates to both top-level dependencies and the dependencies
of those dependencies as well. This is one of the main reasons for making sure
that these files remain in your version control system.

#### Dealing with Lock files as binaries

Since Lock files should not be edited by hand, it's a good idea to have Git treat them as binary files so that they don't produce any visual diffs. You can achieve this by having a `.gitattributes` file define that they are binary files rather than plain text.

<Tabs groupID="JDMT">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm-cli">

```ini title=".gitattributes"
package-lock.json binary
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn" label="classic yarn-cli">

```ini title=".gitattributes"
yarn.lock binary
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Enforcing a particular JDMT

It's important to outline in the project documentation which JDMT is being
leveraged by the project. Mixing both _Yarn_ and _NPM_ is not a good idea. One
of many ways to enforce one over the other is to have the generated file of the
JDMT that you want to ignore in the `.gitignore` file. This way if someone uses
the incorrect JDMT they won't be able to commit the generated Lock file.

<Tabs groupID="JDMT">
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm-cli">

```ini title=".gitignore"
# other gitignore directives

yarn.lock

# other gitignore directives
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn" label="classic yarn-cli">

```ini title=".gitignore"
# other gitignore directives

package-lock.json

# other gitignore directives
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Why is this Applicable to the Practice as a Whole

This is applicable to the whole practice because JavaScript is a popular
language with many ways to manage dependencies. With this guidance, Truss teams
will be in a much stronger place regarding dependency management and documenting
that process within the context of their own projects.

## When to Not Implement This Decision

There's no need to implement this decision if the project isn't being managed by
a JDMT or doesn't contain any JavaScript.

## Alternatives Considered

A main option here is to use the defaults that JDMT contain around versioning
and tooling. This isn't always ideal.
