# Risk Management Framework - Step 4: Assessment

The purpose of assessing security controls is to ensure they were implemented correctly, operate as intended, and successfully meet the security requirements for the information system. Assessments are required prior to system authorization and annually to ensure that the security measures are working effectively.

A full scope assessment of all security controls must be performed prior to the initial ATO, and the ATO must be renewed every three years. Each year, 1/3 of the controls are tested so that by the end of the third year, all controls have been tested for the ATO renewal. A full scope assessment of the controls can be required if significant changes to the information system are made at any time throughout the lifecycle.

There are currently two approaches for completing assessments:

**A Security Control Assessment (SCA)** is a systematic, manual procedure for evaluating, describing, testing, and examining information system security controls.

**Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT)** is an agency-specific, next-generation assessment based on NISTIR 8011 that relies heavily on automation and focusing on capabilities rather than individual controls.

[NIST SP 800-53A](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53Ar5.pdf), Guide for Assessing the Security Controls in Federal Information Systems and Organizations, has more detailed information about assessing security controls.

[NISTIR 8011](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2017/NIST.IR.8011-1.pdf), Automation Support for Security Control Assessments, has more detailed information about automated assessments and capabilities.
