# [Engineering Playbook](../../README.md) / [Web Development](../README.md) / Front End Guide

## Overview
These are recommendations for front end development.

### Frameworks
We typically choose React as our front end framework of choice.

### Testing
- Jest
- Enzyme

### Style Guide
We generally adhere to the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), unless they conflict with project specific Prettier or lint rules.

### CSS
Follow the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology. Also helpful to follow is the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/).
