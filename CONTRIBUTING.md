# Contributing to the playbook

## What

The playbook is still fairly new, so there are many opportunities to add useful
content. Here are some examples:

- Build out the Ruby section
- Add a Rails section
- Expand on the Python section
- Curated list of books, articles, newsletters, courses, tutorials
- Recommended tools
- Create separate pages for the various editors and IDEs, and expand each with
  more helpful plugins, keyboard shortcuts, and other productivity tips.
- How to be an effective engineer

## When

We aim for the playbook to be a living document. Outdated information can be
worse than no information. If we change our opinions or processes, we should
strive to update the playbook shortly thereafter.

If you feel important content is missing, please submit a PR if you have the
time. If the work needs to be discussed, please reach out in the [#reserve
channel ðŸ”’ in Truss Slack][slack-reserve] to plan and prioritize the work.

## How

If you are adding new content, please follow our
[templates](./templates/README.md). If you are updating existing content, and
you notice that it does not adhere to our templates format, please update the
format in a separate PR if you have time. If the work needs to be discussed,
please reach out in the [#reserve channel ðŸ”’ in Truss Slack][slack-reserve] to
plan and prioritize the work.
