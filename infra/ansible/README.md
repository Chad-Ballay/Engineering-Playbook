# [InfraSec](../README.md) / Ansible

## Overview

Ansible is a configuration management tool that usually operates in a "masterless" fashion, using remote execution via
ssh to implement configuration changes. It is also not common for it to be used as a provisioner in Packer, a tool we
use for building images for deployment in AWS and elsewhere.
