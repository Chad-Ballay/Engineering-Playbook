# Types of ATOs

## Overview

For all federal agencies, the Risk Management Framework (RMF) describes the process that must be followed to secure, authorize, and manage information systems. The RMF defines a process cycle that is used for initially securing the protection of systems through an ATO and integrating ongoing monitoring.

Authorization to Operate (ATO) - This is the end goal for every system. These ATOs are typically issued for 3 years, at which point they must be recertificed.

Conditional ATO (cATO) - This is usually issued to a system where too many outstanding issues were found. This allows the system to operate while the problems are corrected. These problems are tracked and become conditions that must be met at specific time intervals. cATOs are usually issued for less than a year.

Interim Authority to Test (IATT) - An IATT provides provisional authority to operate during system development. During this time period, teams should be working towards implementing controls and documenting the system for their ATO assessment.
