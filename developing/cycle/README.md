# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / Development Cycle

## Overview

At Truss, we practice agile with a small "a". This means getting back to the basics of what it means to [develop software with agility](https://pragdave.me/blog/2014/03/04/time-to-kill-agile.html):

> - Find out where you are
> - Take a small step towards your goal
> - Adjust your understanding based on what you learned
> - Repeat

In order to implement these principles, we do a few things:

- Planning and executing tasks in repeated cycles, called Sprints
- At the end of each cycle, we review our work and whether or we accomplished what we set out to do.
