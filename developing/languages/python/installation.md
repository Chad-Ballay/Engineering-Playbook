# [Python](./README.md) / Installation

Our current recommendation is to use `brew` in order to keep Python up to date. Install the latest version like so:

```
brew install python
```

If you also need a local Python development environment, we would suggest using `pipenv` in order to manage that.

We recommend using [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) as a linter and [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for formatting.
